<!-- How To Use Plant Builder
NOVEMBER 30, 2016	/ LEAVE A COMMENT / EDIT
-Using the rotating picker views, select the plant structure and leaf type you’d like, and whether or not you’d want the plant to be deciduous or not

-Press ‘Test It!’ and then choose from 1 of the 4 habitats to test your creation in

-You will watch a 30 second animation of your creation attempting to live 1 year in the habitat you chose

-Analyze the results to determine your success or how you could design a plant to suite the habitat better -->

<!-- How to use Son of Aaron
OCTOBER 11, 2016	/ LEAVE A COMMENT / EDIT
-Speak a word of your choice into the app once it is open and the search bar has appeared near the bottom of the screen

-After a few seconds the app will read back to you a random verse in which your word appears in the bible

– Copy the most recently read verse by holding your finger on the background picture of the bible and paste it anywhere else in your device. -->

This is for vegetation distribution data collection. I don’t expect anyone to use it but me, especially at this stage. But if you must know:

-Create an Expedition by clicking ‘Add’

-Create Sites within this Expedition by clicking ‘Add Site’

-Once you add a Site, click ‘Time In’ and fill out the different data fields using a GPS device, an altimeter, and your observations

-Enter Taxa by clicking ‘Add Taxa’. This will show all the taxa you have seen in this expedition so far. If you just started, you won’t see any. This page allows for you to quickly select taxa you’ve already seen. If you need to enter new taxa, hit ‘New Taxon’. You can go back to your taxa list and click on the taxon and add observations

-Take photos with your device

-Click ‘Time Out’ before you leave the site -->
